        We’re excited to share that our first working prototype is already complete. The current version is a basic circuit that sends a toggle signal when the button is pressed. Thanks to the built-in Wi-Fi capabilities of the Arduino R4 microcontroller, this prototype can already send emergency alerts directly to designated contacts through the Arduino app.
      </p>
      <p>
        Looking ahead, we’re collaborating with a PCB manufacturer in Bangalore to significantly reduce the size of the device by as much as 70–80%, and transform it into a compact, wearable pendant. With additional funding, we aim to bring this concept to life as a fully-functional, production-ready product that makes safety both accessible and effortless.
